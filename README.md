# PhysMath2 Coding Assignments

Ideas for coding assignments for [my lectures](https://www2.nsysu.edu.tw/iwamoto/physmath2.html) based on [Kreyszig's textbook](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/-p-9781119446842).

## Requirements

You need to install [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/) and [`SciPy`](https://scipy.org/).

```bash
# commands may be python3 and pip3 on your system,
python --version  # Check version >= 3.8
pip --version     # Check your pip is for correct Python version

pip install numpy scipy
```

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. [Newton Method](/newton_method.md)
- [ ] 2. [Monte Carlo Simulation](/monte_carlo.md)
- [ ] 3. [Linear Algebra](/linear_algebra.md)
- [ ] 4. [Integration](/integration.md)
- [ ] 5. ODE?
- [ ] 6. Function interpolation?

Open each `.md` file. Following the instructions, edit `.py` files.

## Submission

If you want to submit your work, please notify me by email or on Google Classroom.
Files in your GitHub repository  will be checked.

It is nice if you can specify which *commit* is to be evaluated. To do that, find the *commit id* (commit hash or commit SHA) of the commit you want to submit. See the screenshot below.

If you cannot use GitHub, you may send your files by email, but the work on each task should be contained in one `.py` file. For example, if you want to submit Task 2, send me `linear_algebra.py`.
